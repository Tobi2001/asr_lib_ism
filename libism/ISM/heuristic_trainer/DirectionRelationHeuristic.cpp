                 * Calculate a direction Vector from first to second for every Frame.
                 * Check in every frame the angle between the reference vector (first vector) and the current vector.
                 * If the misalignment is more than mMaxAngleDeviation degrees, increase staticBreaks and
                 * recalculate the reference vote.
                 * Also calculate the average distance between first and second.
                 *
                 * At the end, if the staticBreaks are below mStaticBreakRatio of the sample range,
                 * and they appear together in more than mTogetherRatio of the frames,
                 * and the second is closer to first than the current closest track,
                 * replace the current closest track with second.
                 *
                 * At the end, choose the first<->second combination with the lowest rate of static breaks.
                 *
                 * This will always create a cluster of two tracks.
